Definition:
A Queue is a linear data structure that follows FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

Example: 
A line of people at a ticket counter â€“ the person who comes first gets served first.

Basic Operations:
Enqueue
Dequeue
Peek/Front
isEmpty()
isFull()

Types of Queues:
Simple
Circular
Double-Ended Queue (Deque)
Priority Queue

Implementation:
Using Array
Using LL

Codes: 
1. Queue using Array:  Enqueue; Dequeue; Display
2. Queue using Linked List: Enqueue; Dequeue; Display
3. Circular Queue using Array
4. Circular Queue using Linked List
5. Double Ended Queue (Deque): Input-restricted deque; Output-restricted deque
6. Priority Queue (using Array or Linked List)
7. Implementation of Queue using Stacks (important trick question).
8. Implementation of Stack using Queues (reverse trick).
